Hello!

On February 2nd 2020 at 2PM PT, GitHub will begin snapshotting all of its public repositories that have been active within the prior few months.
The snapshots will be stored in the GitHub Arctic Code Vault at the Arctic World Archive in Svalbard, and is designed to last for 1,000 years.

So if you're reading these warm words in a future far far away, hopefully you're doing good and the world is in a better place.

Special thanks to my grandma Mary Vella for everything she's done for me.
